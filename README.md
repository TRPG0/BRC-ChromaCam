# BRC-ChromaCam

Press a key to hide everything but the player so you can key them out in post.

The key and the background color can both be changed.

The default key is `=` equals.

Not tested very thoroughly. Probably don't try to use this during cutscenes.

Install the mod via [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/TRPG/ChromaCam/), or by following the steps below:

1. Download and install [BepInEx 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) in your Bomb Rush Cyberfunk root folder. *Do not use any pre-release versions of BepInEx 6.*

2. Start Bomb Rush Cyberfunk once so that BepInEx can create its required configuration files.

3. Download `ChromaCam.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/TRPG0/BRC-ChromaCam/releases) page and put it into `BepInEx\plugins`.
